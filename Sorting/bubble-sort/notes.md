# Bubble Sort


We have an unsorted array of integers. We will take an imaginary bubble in which we will put two indices of the array subsequent to each other.
For example 0,1 | 1,2 | 3,4

and then we will compare these indices like if 0 is greater than 1 then swap there positions
next comapre 1 with 2, next 2 with 1 and so on and continue swapping till the last index has the largest number.
